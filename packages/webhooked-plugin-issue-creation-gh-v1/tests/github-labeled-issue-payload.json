I should not have to have two tabs open to do this.\r\n\r\n# Must haves\r\n\r\n* I can the instructions for what I have to do now side-by-side with the world editor.\r\n* I can toggle this world editor to \"full page\" so that the left side mission steps view is collapsed, **and** the right-side Help Requests view is collapsed\r\n* Since I am following a step-by-step mission, when I Save Changes and Continue, the code I just wrote remains in place on the next step.\r\n\r\n# Nice to haves\r\n\r\n* When I'm given new instruction, I have option to show an example that has where the new code can go highlighted with different background colors -- basically like a cheat that shows what the instructor would see -- This is possible with Ace Editor configuration\r\n* I can see who else in the class has completed this step and \"spy\" on their working sample\r\n\r\n# Wows\r\n* The app runs a unit test against my code to determine if I really completed it properly.\r\n* If I have completed it successfully, I can see other people's code too to note any differences.\r\n* Each time I save, it makes a code commit to GitLab or whatever, and keeps a history, so that when the instructor/mentor or another student tries to help me, I can show them my thought process and steps I've tried so far.\r\n  * Part of this, each time I save I can type a message (basically a commit message) to save along with the commit"
